<h1> In memory of Hersh</h1>
<p style="color:black"> 
Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of the most recognizable faces of the heart-wrenching hostage crisis that sparked the Israel-Hamas war, has died at the hands of his captors, according to the Israeli military, bringing a crushing end to a tireless and high-profile international campaign by his parents to secure his release.

The 23-year-old Israeli-American’s ordeal had come to symbolize the pain and agony of the more than 100 hostages still held in Gaza, with banners and murals demanding their return often displayed in Jerusalem and around the world.

His murder, announced Sunday, has sparked fresh heartbreak and horror for the hostage families who fear that time is running out for their loved ones seized by Hamas as pressure grows on the Israeli government to secure a ceasefire agreement.

Goldberg-Polin, who was among the hundreds of young people attending the Nova music festival in southern Israel on October 7, was forced to hide in a bomb shelter with his friends as Hamas militants launched a surprise attack, killing more than 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.As Hamas militants began to lob grenades into the bunker, Goldberg-Polin rushed to throw them out, before his arm was blown off from the elbow down, according to a firsthand account from his friend. When the gunfire settled, Goldberg-Polin was forcibly taken by Hamas gunmen. That was the last time his friend saw him.

The first sign of life from Goldberg-Polin came in April, six months after his capture.

He was shown in a hostage video released by Hamas, with part of his left arm missing and hair cropped short. Speaking in Hebrew, he said he had been “here for almost 200 days” and called on his parents to stay strong for him.

More than four months later, the young Israeli-American was confirmed dead, according to a statement from his family released by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

“With broken hearts, the Goldberg-Polin family is devastated to announce the death of their beloved son and brother, Hersh. The family thanks you all for your love and support and asks for privacy at this time,” the family said in the statement.

CNN has reached out to the family.

The Israeli military said his body was found “brutally murdered” alongside five other hostages in Hamas-run tunnels under the city of Rafah and that they were killed “a short while” before troops were able to reach them.

Two Israel officials later told CNN that three of the six hostages whose bodies were recovered in southern Gaza were expected to be released during the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement. Goldberg-Polin was among them.

Goldberg-Polin, alongside hostages Eden Yerushalmi and Carmel Gat, were slated to be released as part of the “humanitarian category” based on the framework Israel and Hamas agreed to in early July, the officials said.

“Our prime minister delayed it,” one of the Israeli officials said. “It’s way too late for the six who have been killed, but it’s time to reach an agreement.”</p>
